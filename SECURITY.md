# Security Summary for JewelCalc

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive security analysis of JewelCalc2 after implementing the multi-user authentication system and related security enhancements.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Password Security

**Implementation:**
- **Algorithm**: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
- **Iterations**: 100,000 (industry standard for strong password hashing)
- **Salt**: 32-byte random salt per password
- **Storage Format**: `salt:hash` (both in hexadecimal)

**Benefits:**
- Computationally expensive to crack
- Unique salt prevents rainbow table attacks
- 100,000 iterations slow down brute-force attacks
- Modern, recommended algorithm by security experts

**Code Location**: `auth.py` - `hash_password()` and `verify_password()` functions

### 2. Session Management

**Implementation:**
- Streamlit's built-in session state
- Session-based authentication
- User credentials not stored in session (only user ID and role)
- Automatic session cleanup on logout

**Benefits:**
- No need to re-enter credentials during session
- Secure session handling by Streamlit
- Easy logout clears all session data

### 3. Database Security

**Implementation:**
- Separate databases per user
- Central authentication database
- SQL injection protection via parameterized queries
- Input validation before database operations

**Benefits:**
- Complete data isolation between users
- One compromised database doesn't affect others
- SQL injection attacks prevented
- Invalid inputs rejected before reaching database

**Code Location**: `database.py` - All database operations use parameterized queries

### 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Implementation:**
- Two roles: Admin and User
- Admin-only features: User management, system overview
- User features: Customer/invoice management
- Role verified on each request

**Benefits:**
- Principle of least privilege
- Admin functions protected
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Easy to extend with more roles

**Code Location**: `auth.py` - `require_admin()` function

### 5. User Approval Workflow

**Implementation:**
- New registrations default to 'pending' status
- Admin must approve before user can login
- Rejected users deleted from system
- Approval tracked with admin ID and timestamp

**Benefits:**
- Prevents unauthorized access
- Admin control over who uses system
- Audit trail of approvals
- Can reject suspicious registrations

### 6. Input Validation

**Implementation:**
- Phone number validation (10 digits)
- Email format validation (basic)
- Database filename validation (no path traversal)
- Required field validation

**Benefits:**
- Prevents invalid data entry
- Protects against path traversal attacks
- Ensures data quality
- User-friendly error messages

**Code Location**: `utils.py` - `validate_phone()` and throughout form validations

## Known Limitations

### 1. Legacy Password Support

**Issue**: Backward compatibility code for old SHA256 hashes
**Location**: `auth.py` line 31
**Severity**: Low (only for migration, deprecated)
**Mitigation**: 
- Code clearly marked as legacy/deprecated
- TODO comment to remove after migration
- New passwords use PBKDF2 only

### 2. Default Admin Credentials

**Issue**: Default admin account with known password (admin/admin123)
**Severity**: High if not changed
**Mitigation**:
- Clear warning in README to change immediately
- Admin created only on first run
- Can be changed through user management
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Users must change this on first login

### 3. Local Storage

**Issue**: All data stored locally, no encryption at rest
**Severity**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- File system permissions protect database files
- Consider full disk encryption for production
- Regular backups recommended
- Physical security of server important

### 4. No HTTPS Enforcement

**Issue**: Streamlit doesn't enforce HTTPS by default
**Severity**: High in production
**Mitigation**:
- Use reverse proxy (nginx) with SSL in production
- Deploy behind HTTPS-enabled service
- Never use over public internet without SSL
- Local network use is relatively safe

### 5. No Rate Limiting

**Issue**: No protection against brute-force login attempts
**Severity**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Consider adding login attempt tracking
- Implement temporary account lockout after failed attempts
- Use web application firewall in production
- Monitor for suspicious activity

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

### Development Environment
```bash
# Run locally (safe for development)
streamlit run app.py
```

### Production Environment

**Option 1: Nginx Reverse Proxy**
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name jewelcalc.yourdomain.com;
    
    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8501;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

**Option 2: Streamlit Cloud with SSL**
- Deploy to Streamlit Cloud (automatic HTTPS)
- Configure secrets for production
- Enable authentication requirements

### Recommended Security Headers

Add these headers via reverse proxy:
```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR (if applicable)
- Users can request data export (Database tab)
- Users can delete their account (admin function)
- Data stored locally, not shared with third parties
- Clear privacy policy recommended

### Data Protection
- Regular backups recommended
- Secure backup storage essential
- Consider encryption for backups
- Access logging for audit trail

## Incident Response

### If Password Database Compromised
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Force all users to change passwords
   - Review access logs for unauthorized access
   - Notify all users of the breach
   - Change default admin password

2. **Investigation**:
   - Determine scope of compromise
   - Check for data exfiltration
   - Review system logs
   - Identify attack vector

3. **Remediation**:
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Reset all passwords
   - Update security measures
   - Document lessons learned

### If User Database Compromised
1. Notify affected user
2. Restore from backup if available
3. Review and strengthen access controls
4. Audit other user databases
5. Consider implementing encryption at rest

## Security Testing

### Automated Tests
Run the test suite to verify security functions:
```bash
python test_app.py
```

Tests include:
- Password hashing verification
- Authentication flow testing
- Input validation checks
- Database operation security

### Manual Security Testing

**Test 1: Authentication**
- Try login with wrong password → Should fail
- Try accessing admin features as user → Should be blocked
- Try SQL injection in login → Should be prevented

**Test 2: Authorization**
- Login as user, try to access admin panel → Should not see tab
- Login as admin, verify all features available
- Test role changes take effect immediately

**Test 3: Data Isolation**
- Create data as User A
- Login as User B
- Verify User B cannot see User A's data

**Test 4: Input Validation**
- Try invalid phone numbers → Should be rejected
- Try path traversal in database filename → Should be blocked
- Try XSS in text fields → Should be sanitized

## Vulnerability Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Contact the developer privately at the repository
3. Provide detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow time for patch development
5. Coordinate public disclosure after fix
